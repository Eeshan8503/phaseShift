     <QnA num={9} question="Case study1: There is always a quest to understand what sews the universe together but soon the deepest mysteries of the world will be unravelled. They completed the standard model using the planets largest machine whose detectors detect subtle patterns using complex computations. These experiments produce 1 petabyte of data per second, analysing this data requires almost a million CPU cores in 170 locations across the world !!!! Case study 2: Since their start using ligroin they have come a long way moving goods and people across the globe. Now the industry is transiting into a new age, we have to reduce our burden on the planet.They aim to be carbon neutral. The world knows to make a battery but no one really knows what happens inside a battery at molecular level while it’s working. simulating its working involves accounting for a tremendous number of electron interactions each electron influencing the other in complex ways. It takes many days to perform the simulation using the current known algorithms which makes the process laborious!!!!!. The above cases have a common limitation and they have joined hands with a company which has a possible solution. Name the company’s first machine designed which has the potential to be the solution.
